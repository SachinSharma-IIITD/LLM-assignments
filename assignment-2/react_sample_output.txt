To approach this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Step 1: Reasoning about the immediate next step.
To determine the number of real solutions of the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0, we should analyze the function f(x) = e^x + x - 2 and its behavior in the interval [0, 1] and outside this interval. 

Since the next step involves analyzing the behavior of the function, let's analyze the function's behavior in the interval [0, 1].

Compute answer for the latest step.
Since we are analyzing the behavior of the function f(x) = e^x + x - 2 in the interval [0, 1], let's evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval, which are x = 0 and x = 1.

f(0) = e^0 + 0 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1
f(1) = e^1 + 1 - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0

Since the function has opposite signs at the endpoints of the interval, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, the function must have at least one real solution in the interval [0, 1].

Reasoning Performed:
Since we have established that the function f(x) = e^x + x - 2 has at least one real solution in the interval [0, 1] by the Intermediate Value Theorem, let's consider the behavior of the function in the next step.

The next step would be to analyze the behavior of the function outside the interval [0, 1]. 

Action: Think about how the function behaves as x approaches infinity and negative infinity.

Since the next step involves analyzing the behavior of the function as x approaches infinity and negative infinity, let's consider the following:

As x approaches infinity, the term e^x in the function f(x) = e^x + x - 2 becomes very large, and the term x becomes negligible in comparison. Therefore, the function behaves like e^x as x approaches infinity.

As x approaches negative infinity, the term e^x in the function f(x) = e^x + x - 2 approaches zero, and the term x becomes very large and negative. Therefore, the function behaves like x as x approaches negative infinity.

Since we have analyzed the behavior of the function f(x) = e^x + x - 2 as x approaches infinity and negative infinity, let's consider the behavior of the function in the next step.

Now, let's think about how many real solutions the function f(x) = e^x + x - 2 might have in the interval [0, 1] and outside this interval.

Option 1: k = 0 and n = 1
Option 2: k = 1 and n = 0
Option 3: k = n = 1
Option 4: k > 1

We have established that the function has at least one real solution in the interval [0, 1] by the Intermediate Value Theorem. 

The function f(x) = e^x + x - 2 has a real solution at x = 1, which is in the interval [0, 1].

Now, let's analyze the behavior of the function as x approaches negative infinity. Since the function behaves like x as x approaches negative infinity, the function will have one real solution that is not in the interval [0, 1].

The function has one real solution in the interval [0, 1] and one real solution that is not in the interval [0, 1].

Option 3: k = n = 1
