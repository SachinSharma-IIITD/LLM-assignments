# Analysis of Layer-wise Representation Performance in LLMs

## Key Observations
- Classification: Last layer > Middle layer > First layer (accuracy)
- Regression: Middle layer > Last layer > First layer (loss)

## Potential Explanations

### 1. Nature of Task Representations

#### Classification
The superior performance of the last layer in classification tasks can be attributed to:

1. **Discrete Category Formation**
   - Last layers tend to form more linearly separable representations for distinct categories
   - Research by Belinkov et al. (2017) in "What do Neural Machine Translation Models Learn about Morphology?" shows that higher layers learn more abstract, task-specific features
   - Paper "On the Relationship between Self-Attention and Convolutional Layers" (Cordonnier et al., 2020) demonstrates how later layers specialize in categorical distinctions

2. **Information Compression**
   - Last layers compress information into discriminative features optimal for classification
   - Referenced in "Information-Theoretic Probing with Minimum Description Length" (Voita & Titov, 2020)

#### Regression

The better performance of middle layers in regression tasks might be explained by:

1. **Continuous Feature Preservation**
   - Middle layers maintain richer continuous-valued features needed for regression
   - Last layers may over-compress continuous information while optimizing for task-specific outputs
   - Supported by "What Does BERT Look At? An Analysis of BERT's Attention" (Clark et al., 2019)

2. **Feature Granularity**
   - Middle layers strike a balance between abstract features and fine-grained details
   - Last layers might lose some numerical precision while forming more categorical representations
   - Discussed in "How Contextual are Contextualized Word Representations?" (Liu et al., 2019)

### 2. Optimization Dynamics

1. **Training Objective Impact**
   - Language models are typically trained with classification-like objectives (next token prediction)
   - This may bias the last layer towards discrete categorical representations
   - Explored in "What Does BERT Learn about the Structure of Language?" (Jawahar et al., 2019)

2. **Gradient Flow**
   - Middle layers might preserve more general-purpose representations due to balanced gradient flow
   - Last layers may be more specialized due to direct optimization pressure
   - Discussed in "Visualizing and Understanding the Effectiveness of BERT" (Lin et al., 2019)

## Limitations and Caveats

Please note that while I've provided citations to support these explanations, as an AI system, I may have imperfect recall of the exact contents of these papers. It's recommended to verify these citations and their specific findings. Additionally, the behavior observed might be specific to:

1. The particular model architecture (LLaMA-3)
2. The specific probing setup using RadonForest
3. The nature of the classification and regression tasks being probed

## Future Research Directions

1. Investigating whether this pattern holds across different:
   - Model architectures
   - Probing methods
   - Task types

2. Analyzing the information content and feature distributions at different layers using information-theoretic measures

3. Studying the impact of pre-training objectives on layer-wise representation characteristics
