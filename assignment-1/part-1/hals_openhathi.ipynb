Sanskrit and Hindi vocabulary There are many Hindi vocabulary words which originate from Sanskrit. The table below contains some examples of such words. Table: examples of vocabulary words which are similar in Sanskrit and Hindi Hindi Sanskrit English शांति (shaanti) शान्ति (shaanti) peace आग (aag) अग्नि (agni) fire चांद (caand) चन्द्र (candra) moon नदी (nadī)',\n",

       " 'राजन् (rājan) king सिंह (sinh) सिंह (simha) lion During recent centuries, Sanskrit has remained relatively free from outside linguistic influences, whereas Hindi has absorbed many words from other languages —Persian and English, in particular. The Mughal Empire ruled the Indian subcontinent between the 16th and the 19th centuries. The Taj Mahal was built during that period. Persian was the language of the court, which explains why Hindi has many loanwords from Persian.

Hindi is less than one thousand years old. So, it is a much more recent language than Sanskrit. The',\n",
       " 'recent language than Sanskrit. The use of Sanskrit spans a very long period, so there are differences between the earlier form (Vedic Sanskrit) and the later form (Classical Sanskrit). The Devanagari script is used for writing both Sanskrit and Hindi A variety of writing systems have been used for the Sanskrit language, depending on the time in history and the location. Today it is common for Sanskrit texts to be written in the Devanagari script, which is also used to write in Hindi. The Devanagari script is classified as an alphasyllabary, also called an “abugida” by some linguists. This type',\n",
       " \"by some linguists. This type of script consists of symbols representing syllables rather than individual sounds. The inherent vowel of consonant symbols The Devanagari script uses consonant symbols that have an inherent vowel. For instance, the symbol “त” represents the syllable “ta”. The default vowel in this writing system is 'a', which is a very common vowel in both Sanskrit and Hindi. Additional marks are added to the symbol to change the vowel from the default. For example, “ति” corresponds to the syllable “ti”, and “तु” corresponds to the syllable “tu”. To suppress the inherent vowel, an additional marker is\",\n",
       " 'vowel, an additional marker is used (which is called a Virama). For example, “त्” corresponds to the pure consonant “t”. The linguistic phenomenon of “schwa deletion” in spoken Hindi Sanskrit, when written using the Devanagari script, is highly phonetic because words are pronounced the way they are spelled. One way in which Hindi differs from Sanskrit is that it is less phonetic. Hindi is considered less phonetic than Sanskrit due to a linguistic phenomenon known as “schwa deletion” in spoken Hindi. This refers to the non-pronunciation of one of the default vowels in some Hindi words, even though there is',\n",
       " 'words, even though there is no Virama marker indicating its absence. For example, the word “वन” means “forest” in both Sanskrit and Hindi. In Sanskrit, this word is exactly as it is spelled: “vana”. However, in Hindi, it is pronounced “van”. Comparing Sanskrit and Hindi Grammar There are a few reasons why Hindi grammar is considered simpler than Sanskrit grammar. One of the main reasons is that Hindi has fewer noun cases than Sanskrit, which makes noun declension less complex. Grammatical gender is also simpler in Hindi compared to Sanskrit. Each Sanskrit noun has one of three possible grammatical genders',\n",
       " 'of three possible grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). For example: The Sanskrit word चन्द्र (candra) which means “moon” is masculine. The Sanskrit word नदी (nadī) which means “river” is feminine. The Sanskrit word ज्ञान (jñāna) which means “knowledge” is neuter. In contrast, Hindi nouns have one of two possible grammatical genders (masculine and feminine). Conclusion In some ways, the relationship between Sanskrit and Hindi is similar to the relationship between Latin and Italian. Many Hindi vocabulary words come from Sanskrit, but there are significant grammatical differences between the two languages. To further explore this topic, refer to this list',\n",
